In 1986, Professor Michael Stonebreaker started the post-ingres project after creating ingres which was the predecessor of Postgres in hopes to change the database landscape of the time and create a database engine that could be extended by the users using objects.

Version 4.2 of Postgres was first released in 1994 under an MIT license that allowed other people to collaborate in this project as well. Postgres used QUEL as it's main programming language at the time which was then replaced with SQL.

In 1996 the project gained enough traction and funding to host a server and started working on the re-branded PostgreSQL project which has been under development for over 30 years now.
