Postgres comes with it's own version of SQL called PgSQL that allows developers and database admins to create functions, procedures, triggers, and views according to their needs.

Postgres can also be extended with embedded languages such as Perl and Bash and extensions like GIS that allow it to handle geo spatial data.
