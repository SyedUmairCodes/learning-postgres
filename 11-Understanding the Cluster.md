PostgreSQL is an enterprise level database management solution and by no means it is a simple software. But, due to the great design, implementation, and documentation created for it learning the inner workings of PostgreSQL isn't as complicated as it might seem.

There are two main ways to interact with your cluster, using the command line client `PSQL` that comes with the PostgreSQL installer and is the default method of connecting to the cluster. The second one is to use a GUI-based client such as `PgAdmin`.
