Postgres is a relational database management system that uses SQL as it's main programming language. A single instance of postgres can store upto 4 billion individual databases each with a billion tables and rows.

> The amount of databases and tables stored in an instance is dependent on the configuration of the server that the instance is hosted on and may be different on each instance.

Postgres, if configured correctly and given the resources can store almost an unlimited amount of data but shouldn't be used as a dumping ground for storage.
